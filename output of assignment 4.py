Move disk 1 from rod B to rod C
Move disk 3 from rod A to rod B
Move disk 1 from rod C to rod A
Move disk 2 from rod C to rod B
Move disk 1 from rod A to rod B
Move disk 4 from rod A to rod C
Move disk 1 from rod B to rod C
Move disk 2 from rod B to rod A
Move disk 1 from rod C to rod A
Move disk 3 from rod B to rod C
Move disk 1 from rod A to rod B
Move disk 2 from rod A to rod C
Move disk 1 from rod B to rod C

Number of steps will be: 15

Solution for second ques:
Enter the number of rows you want to print: 6
The Pascal's Triangle using recursion is:
     1 
    1 1 
   1 2 1 
  1 3 3 1 
 1 4 6 4 1 
1 5 10 10 5 1 
The Pascal's Triangle using iteration is:
     1 
    1 1 
   1 2 1 
  1 3 3 1 
 1 4 6 4 1 
1 5 10 10 5 1 

Solution for third ques:
Enter first integer value(dividend): 165
Enter second integer value(divisor): 22

Quotient: 7 
Remainder: 11

a. Check whether the function (divmod()) is callable or not:
True, which means it is callable

b. Check whether all the values are zero or not:
All values in result(i.e. quotient and remainder) are non-zero.

c. Add (4,5,6) to the result and filter out values greater than 4:
Values greater than 4(in list format) are: [5, 6, 7, 11]

d. Convert the above result into a set datatype:
The output of previous part in set datatype would be: {11, 5, 6, 7}

e. Make the set immutable:
The immutable set would be: frozenset({11, 5, 6, 7})

f. Evaluate the maximum value from the set and find out its hash value:
The maximum value from the set is: 11
The hash value of 11(considering it to be integer) is 11 and its hash value is -366443432698983649(if we consider 11 as a string).

Solution for fourth ques:
Enter name of student: Deep Choudhary
Enter SID of Deep Choudhary: 21105008
Object Created

The name of the student is Deep Choudhary and his/her roll number is 21105008

Object destroyed

Solution for fifth ques:
The current database is:
Mehak has a salary of 40000 rupees
Ashok has a salary of 50000 rupees
Viren has a salary of 60000 rupees

a. Updated the salary of Mehak from 40000 to 70000

b. Deleted the record of Viren(whose salary is 60000)

The final database is:
Mehak has a salary of 70000 rupees
Ashok has a salary of 50000 rupees
